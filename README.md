*   **Showdown Compatible:** Clean text output that can be pasted directly into **Pokémon Showdown** teambuilder.
*   **Perfect Accuracy:** Handles **Nature Mints** (Effective Nature) and **IV Candies/Hyper Training** (Effective IVs) correctly.
*   **Clean Output:** No useless UUIDs, catch balls, or HP values—just what you need for competitive play.

    *   **New/Snapshot:** Create history files (e.g., `party_export_1.txt`, `party_export_2.txt`).
*   **Click-to-Open:** Once exported, click the filename in the chat to instantly open the file on your computer!

## ⚠️ Important Note for PC Export

Since this is a **Client-Side Mod**, your game client does not know what is inside your PC Storage until you open the PC block.

> **If you get an error saying "PC Storage not found":**
> 1. Place a PC block in-game.
> 2. Open it once.
> 3. Close it.
> 4. Run the command again.

This caches the box data to your client so the mod can read it!
